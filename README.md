# React-Crystals

# Built with React

* Crystal game where you have to guess the number that each crystal represent and add them to match a given random number.

## Getting Started

## Rules of the Game
This is a pretty straightforward memory challenge game. Click on a Crystal. Each time you click, your score will go up by a random number between 1-10 this is the value of the crystal. If you match the given score, you win! otherwise if you go over the given number you lose, all the numbers will be randomly shuffled each game. Good luck!
